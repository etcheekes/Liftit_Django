# liftit-django

This project continues on from my lifit app (see repository [here](https://github.com/etcheekes/LiftIt)). The main purpose is to recreate the app but using Django and 
PostgreSQL as the backend instead of flask and SQLite. My reasoning for doing so is to expand my experience with Django (a more popular backend framework) and also to simplify deployment.

If wishing to see the liftit web app's frontend development and/or the flask backend please go to the depository [here](https://github.com/etcheekes/LiftIt)
to see the commit history which covers the start of the project up to this point (07/02/23).

TODO: provide introduction to lifit app and updated description of any files (where necessary)
